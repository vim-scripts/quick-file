Wonder how to locate and jump to file in vim real quick?
Here is a solution. (It helps me a lot)

:QF [part-of-file-name] [additional] [...]

e.g.:
abc.txt, efg.txt, sub/abc.txt, sub/sub2/efg.txt

:QF abc // will jump to abc.txt
:QF abc sub // will jump to sub/abc.txt
:QF efg //will jump to efg.txt
:QF hohoho //will stay put
